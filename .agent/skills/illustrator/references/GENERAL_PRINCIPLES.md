# General Principles for Software Illustration

These are flexible principles to guide the Illustrator agent.

## 1. Contextual Harmony
- The illustration MUST be an extension of the UI. 
- The illustration should follow the Visual Identity, Mood, Theme, Colors, Typography of the project.

## 2. Visual Anchoring
- **Lighting Sychronization**: If the UI uses shadows (detected in CSS), the illustration should have matching light sources and consistent shadow softness.
- **Compositional Awareness**: If text is overlaid (e.g., "title on the left"), the illustration MUST be weighted to the opposite side to maintain contrast and legibility.
- **Color Anchoring**: Use the exact HEX codes discovered in the project's brand for key accents to "lock" the image to the site.

## 3. Metaphorical Clarity
- Avoid generic imagery. 
- Use the **Object + Action** formula:
  - Subject: An element from the Project's theme (e.g., A painter's brush for an Art Gallery, a glowing chip for Tech).
  - Action: The concept being illustrated (e.g., "Analyzing", "Creating", "Securing").

## 3. Physical & Digital Dimensions
- **Aspect Ratio (Imagen 4.0 Restricted)**: You MUST choose from these specific ratios:
  - **1:1**: Square (Ideal for feature cards or profile icons).
  - **16:9**: Wide (Best for Heros and Headers).
  - **4:3**: Standard landscape.
  - **3:4**: Portrait.
  - **9:16**: Vertical (Full mobile story style).
- **Scale & Resolution**:
  - Request high resolution (e.g., 2048px width) for Heros to avoid pixelation.
  - Consider the final file format (PNG for transparency, JPG for photographs/paintings, SVG-style for icons).
- **Responsiveness**:
  - Small sizes: Reduce visual complexity (fewer elements) to remain readable.
  - Large sizes: Use the extra space for textures or secondary brand details.
- **Placement Context**: Check if the image will have text overlaid (requires clear space in the composition).
