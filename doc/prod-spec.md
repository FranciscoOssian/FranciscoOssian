# Product Specification — Francisco Ossian Portfolio

## 1) Product Purpose
The Francisco Ossian Portfolio (foln.dev) exists as a professional digital presence for a full-stack developer. Its primary purpose is to showcase technical skills, highlight completed projects, share knowledge through a blog, and facilitate direct contact with potential clients or collaborators. It solves the problem of professional visibility and provides a centralized hub for his professional identity.

## 2) Target Users
- **Potential Clients:** Looking for a full-stack developer for new projects, maintenance, or consultations.
- **Recruiters/Employers:** Evaluating technical skills and project experience.
- **Tech Community:** Reading blog posts and exploring shared projects.
- **Collaborators:** Interested in joint ventures or open-source activities.

## 3) Core User Flows
- **Exploring Professional Background:** Users land on the home page, read the "About" section and "What I do" to understand the developer's expertise.
- **Reviewing Projects:** Users scroll to the "Projects" section, interact with the project list to see details, and follow links to external repositories or live demos.
- **Consuming Technical Content:** Users navigate to the "Blog" section, browse post summaries, and read full articles.
- **Initiating Contact:** Users use the WhatsApp CTA buttons or social media links in the header/footer to start a conversation.

## 5) Non-Goals
- **Direct E-commerce:** The site does not sell products or services directly through a checkout system.
- **Interactive User Community:** No comment sections, user accounts, or forums.
- **Content Management Interface:** The site itself does not provide a UI for editing content; it is purely a consumer of external data.

## 7) Constraints (Product-Level)
- **Content Language:** Primarily in Portuguese (PT-BR).
- **Communication Channel:** Relies heavily on external platforms (WhatsApp, GitHub, LinkedIn) for interaction.
- **Update Frequency:** Dependent on the developer's manual updates to a separate GitHub repository.

## 8) Success Criteria
