## About me

I always like technology and today I work with it. In high school I started learn C language through youtube. Today I am a university student and front-end developer. I like everything that involves technology, from the depth of problem solving to the visual part.

React and React Native since 2019, developing authorial projects and projects made for the market. Also having knowledge of back-end programming, being very familiar with full-stack.

Currently working as a Front-end web developer, having an experience with React.js and Next.js, but also having a personal experience as a fullstack developing authoring projects.
