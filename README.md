  My name is Francisco, and I study computer science at UECE.

## About me

I have always been passionate about technology, and now I work with it. I first started learning C language through YouTube during high school, and now I am a university student and front-end developer. I enjoy everything that involves technology, from the depths of problem-solving to the visual aspects.

I have been working with React and React Native since 2019, developing both personal and market-driven projects. I also have knowledge of back-end programming and am comfortable working as a full-stack developer.

Currently, I work as a front-end web developer, with experience in React.js and Next.js. I also have personal experience as a full-stack developer, creating my own projects.
